# Inventory Test

A simple proof-of-concept inventory mockup created in C++ using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

- Open/Close inventory using `[escape]` `[tab]` or `[i]`.
- Drag items and move them around the inventory. That's about it.
- The hotkeys work btw! Drag an item to the hotkey bar and you can select it with the corresponding key.
